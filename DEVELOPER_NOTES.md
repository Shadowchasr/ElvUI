# Technical Implementation Details - ElvUI Memory Optimization System

This document provides technical details about the memory optimization system for developers who wish to understand the implementation or contribute to its development.

## System Architecture

The memory optimization system consists of five main components:

1. **MemoryOptimizer**: Core memory management
2. **ModuleOptimizer**: Module loading management
3. **TextOptimizer**: Text rendering optimization
4. **MemoryDashboard**: Memory usage monitoring
5. **WindToolsOptimizer**: WindTools plugin integration

These components are loaded via the `MemoryOptimizationLoader.lua` file, which registers them with ElvUI and sets up the necessary commands and hooks.

## Memory Optimizer

### Key Functions
- `OptimizeMemory()`: Main optimization routine that cleans caches and collects garbage
- `CleanTextureCache()`: Removes unused textures from cache to free memory
- `ForceGC()`: Forces a full garbage collection cycle
- `InitTextureManager()`: Sets up texture caching system

### Technical Features
- Texture reference tracking via `hooksecurefunc` on `SetTexture`
- Intelligent garbage collection scheduling that avoids running during combat
- Memory usage statistics tracking for performance monitoring
- Script result caching to avoid redundant calculations

## Module Optimizer

### Key Functions
- `DelayModule()`: Delays initialization of non-essential modules
- `LoadModule()`: Loads a delayed module when needed
- `SetupModules()`: Determines which modules to delay during initialization
- `OptimizeDataTexts()`: Reduces update frequency of non-essential DataTexts

### Technical Features
- Preserves original module initialization functions for later execution
- Maintains a registry of delayed modules with their status
- Configurable aggressive mode that can delay more modules
- Safe combat mode that ensures all modules are loaded when entering combat

## Text Optimizer

### Key Functions
- `OptimizeText()`: Sets up text rendering optimization
- `ProcessUpdateQueue()`: Updates text elements in batches
- `SetupFontStringPool()`: Creates a recyclable pool of FontString objects

### Technical Features
- Text update throttling via an update queue system
- FontString object pooling to reduce memory allocations
- Smart visibility checks to skip updating hidden elements
- Hooks into FontString creation and text setting functions

## Memory Dashboard

### Key Functions
- `ShowDashboard()`: Displays the memory usage dashboard
- `UpdateData()`: Gathers current memory usage data from addons
- `UpdateDashboard()`: Refreshes the dashboard UI
- `AddHistoryPoint()`: Records memory usage over time for trending

### Technical Features
- Uses AceGUI for the dashboard interface
- Sorting and filtering of addon memory usage data
- Historical memory usage tracking with configurable retention
- CPU usage tracking (when available)

## WindTools Optimizer

### Key Functions
- `OptimizeWindTools()`: Sets up WindTools optimization
- `DelayModule()`: Delays initialization of non-essential WindTools modules
- `LoadModule()`: Loads a delayed WindTools module when needed

### Technical Features
- Similar approach to the ModuleOptimizer but specifically for WindTools
- Safe mode that loads all WindTools modules when entering combat
- Compatible with the latest WindTools version structure

## Configuration System

The system uses the standard ElvUI configuration framework with these additions:

- `General_MemoryOptimizer.lua`: Memory optimizer settings
- `General_ModuleOptimizer.lua`: Module optimizer settings
- `General_TextOptimizer.lua`: Text optimizer settings
- `General_MemoryDashboard.lua`: Memory dashboard settings
- `General_WindToolsOptimizer.lua`: WindTools optimizer settings

Each file registers its own configuration options in the ElvUI options panel under the "General" section.

## Integration Points

The system integrates with ElvUI at these key points:

1. **Module Registration**: Via `E:RegisterModule()`
2. **Command Registration**: Via `E:RegisterChatCommand()`
3. **DataText System**: Provides a Memory Usage DataText
4. **Hook System**: Uses `hooksecurefunc` to intercept relevant functions
5. **Config System**: Adds configuration options to the ElvUI options panel
6. **Timer System**: Uses AceTimer for scheduled tasks

## Performance Considerations

- All optimizers avoid running during combat to prevent performance issues
- Text updates are throttled and batched to reduce CPU usage
- Memory operations like garbage collection are scheduled during idle times
- Texture cache has a configurable size limit to prevent memory bloat
- FontString pooling is limited to specific UI elements to avoid conflicts

## Future Enhancements

Potential areas for future development:

1. **Further Module Optimization**: Identify more modules that can be safely delayed
2. **Advanced Profiling**: More detailed performance analysis tools
3. **Enhanced Texture Management**: More sophisticated texture caching algorithms
4. **Integration with More Plugins**: Support for other popular ElvUI plugins
5. **Frame Pooling**: Extend object pooling beyond FontStrings to frames and textures

## Developer Notes

When working with this system, keep these points in mind:

- Always test changes with both standard and aggressive optimization modes
- Ensure combat safety by testing all features during combat
- Check compatibility with all WoW versions (Retail, Classic, etc.)
- Consider the impact on other ElvUI plugins
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing ElvUI configurations
